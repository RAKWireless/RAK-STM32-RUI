## [3.3.0] - 2015-08-07

### General

- Release based on "LoRaWAN specification 1.0.0"
- GitHub reported issues corrections

### Added

- Added the support for LoRaWAN Class C devices
- Added the possibility to change the channel mask and number of repetitions trough SRV_MAC_LINK_ADR_REQ command when ADR is disabled

### Changed

- Increased FSK SyncWord timeout value in order to listen for longer time if a down link is available or not. Makes FSK downlink more reliable
- Increased the UART USB FIFO buffer size in order to handle bigger chunks of data
- Renamed data rates as per LoRaWAN specification
- Changed confirmed messages function to use default datarate when ADR control is off
- After a Join accept the node falls back to the default datarate. Enables the user to Join a network using a different datarate from its own default one
- Moved the MAC commands processing to the right places. FOpts field before the Payload and Port 0 just after the decryption. (Pull request #9)

### Fixed

- Implemented the radios errata note workarounds. SX1276 errata 2.3 "Receiver Spurious Reception of a LoRa Signal" is not yet implemented
- Fixed handling of the MAC commands which was done incorrectly the condition to verify the length of the buffer has changed from `<` to `<=`
- Fixed `Rx1DrOffset` management. In previous version DR1 was missing for all offsets
- Fixed default FSK channel frequency
- Fixed a firmware freeze when one of the following situations arrived in `OnRxDone` callback: bad address, bad MIC, bad frame. (Pull request #10)
- Fixed weird conditions to check data rate on MAC command `SRV_MAC_NEW_CHANNEL_REQ` (Pull request #7)
- Fixed join accept message handling to be ignored if already joined (Pull request #6)
- Fixed channel index verification should use OR on `SRV_MAC_NEW_CHANNEL_REQ` command (Pull request #5)
- Fixed the CFList management on JoinAccept. The `for` loop indexes were wrong. (Pull request #4)
- Fixed AES key size (Pull request #3)

## [3.2.0] - 2015-04-30

### General

- Release based on "LoRaWAN specification 1.0.0"
- GitHub reported issues corrections

### Added

- Added the support of packed structures when using IAR tool chain
- Added a function to get the time in us
- Added a typedef for time variables (TimerTime_t)
- Added a function that returns if the GPS has a fix or not
- Added missing MAC commands and updated others when necessary
  - Corrected the Port 0 MAC commands decryption
  - Changed the way the upper layer is notified. Now it is only  notified
    when all the operations are finished

      When a ClassA Tx cycle starts a timer is launched to check every second if everything is finished

  - Added a new parameter to `LoRaMacEventFlags` structure that indicates on which Rx window the data has been received
  - Added a new parameter to `LoRaMacEventFlags` structure that indicates if there is applicative data on the received payload
  - Corrected ADR MAC command behavior
  - DutyCycle enforcement implementation (EU868 PHY only)

    **REMARK 1** *The regulatory duty cycle enforcement is enabled by default which means that for lower data rates the
     node may not transmit a new frame as quickly as requested  
    The formula used to compute the node idle time is*

        Toff = TimeOnAir / DutyCycle - TxTimeOnAir

    *Example:*  
    *A device just transmitted a 0.5 s long frame on one default channel
    This channel is in a sub-band allowing 1% duty-cycle. Therefore this whole sub-band (868 MHz - 868.6 MHz) will be
     unavailable for 49.5 s.*

    **REMARK 2** *The duty cycle enforcement can be disabled for test purposes by calling the `LoRaMacSetDutyCycleOn`
     function with false parameter.*
  - Implemented aggregated duty cycle management
  - Added a function to create new channels
  - Implemented the missing features on the JoinAccept MAC command
  - Updated LoRaMacJoinDecrypt function to handle the CFList field
- Added the possibility to chose to use either public or private networks

### Changed

- Cosmetic updates
- Changed the TimeOnAir radio function to return a uint32_t value instead of a double. The value is in us
- Changed the GetPosition functions to return a latitude and longitude of 0 and altitude of 65535 when no GPS fix
- Due to duty cycle management the applicative API has changed  
  All applications must be updated accordingly

### Removed

- Removed support for previous LoRaMac/LoRaWAN specifications

### Fixed

- Fixed the 250 kHz bandwidth choice for the FSK modem
