@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on the STM32WLxx Nucleo board.

  - STM32WLxx Nucleo board Set-up
    - Connect the Nucleo board to your PC with a USB cable type A to micro-B
      to ST-LINK connector.
    - Please ensure that the ST-LINK connector jumpers are fitted.

  - Configure the software via the configuration files:
    - CM0PLUS (Mw and radio drivers config)
        - sys_conf.h, radio_conf.h, mw_log_conf.h, main.h, etc
    - CM4 (Sigfox application)
        - sys_conf.h, sgfx_app.h, nucleo_conf.h, main.h, etc

@par How to use it ?
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - use the script \Scripts\<MyPreferredToolchain>\build.bat to rebuild the SBSFU and the Sigfox projects
  - use the script \Scripts\<MyPreferredToolchain>\program.bat to download the big binary on target device
  - Open a Terminal, connected the device
  - UART Config depends on which trace you want to see:
    - in order to see SBSFU trace : UART Config = 115200, 8b, 1 stopbit, no parity, no flow control
    - in order to see Sigfox trace : UART Config = 9600, 8b, 1 stopbit, no parity, no flow control
  - Terminal Config: Select 'CR+LF' for Transmit New-Line and switch 'Local echo' on
  - Reset the system (two cores)
  - SBSFU check if new fw to be downloaded otherwise verifies the user Sigfox fw signature and execute it
  - Push Button 1 (it will send a sigfox message, Blue LED blinking)

@par How to debug ?
  - change or undefine following definitions in above files:
    - in ..\2_Images_SBSFU\CM0PLUS\app_sfu.h
      /*#define SFU_RDP_PROTECT_ENABLE*/
      /*#define SFU_C2SWDBG_PROTECT_ENABLE*/
    - in ..\2_Images_SBSFU\Common\app_sfu_common.h
      /*#define SFU_DAP_PROTECT_ENABLE*/
      /*#define SFU_C2_DDS_PROTECT_ENABLE*/
      #define SFU_HIDE_PROTECTION_CFG OB_SECURE_HIDE_PROTECTION_DISABLE
    - in ..\2_Images_SBSFU\CM0PLUS\SBSFU\Target\sfu_low_level.c
      set UartHandle.Init.BaudRate = 9600U; (optional: it avoids switching the hyper-terminal but it slows the download)
    - in .\Sigfox_PushButton_DualCore\CM4\Core\Inc\sys_conf.h
      #define DEBUGGER_ENABLED   1   to debug CM4
      #define LOW_POWER_DISABLE   1  at least on one MCU (CM4 or CM0PUS)
    - in .\Sigfox_PushButton_DualCore\CM0PLUS\Core\Inc\sys_conf.h
      #define DEBUGGER_ENABLED   1   to debug CM0PLUS
      #define LOW_POWER_DISABLE   1  at least on one MCU (CM4 or CM0PUS)
  - use the script \Scripts\<MyPreferredToolchain>\build.bat to rebuild the SBSFU and the Sigfox projects
  - use the script \Scripts\<MyPreferredToolchain>\program.bat to download the big binary on target device
  - if needed set hyper-terminal to 115200 to see SBSFU trace
  - unplug and plug the USB reconnect the board to the PC
  - SBSFU run first then Sigfox_PushButton starts
  - Sigfox_PushButton CM4 code enters in while(1) loop waiting the push button BUTTON_SW2 to be pressed
  - the CM0PLUS code is in while(1) loop waiting the CM4 to set CPUS_BOOT_SYNC_ALLOW_CPU2_TO_START
  - if you need to debug CM4 open your preferred toolchain and select CM4 project and attach to running target
  - if you need to debug CM0PLUS open your preferred toolchain and select CM0PLUS project and attach to running target
  - set the breakpoints either in CM4 or CM0PLUS or both debugger instances
  - set hyper-terminal to 9600 to see Sigfox_PushButton trace
  - press the push button BUTTON_SW2:
     - CM4 exits its while(1) loop and executes MBMUXIF_SetCpusSynchroFlag(1) and reaches the CM4 breakpoint
     - this allows CM0PLUS to exit its while(1) loop and to reach the CM0PLUS breakpoint
