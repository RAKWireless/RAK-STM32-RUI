@par Application Description

The Secure Boot (SB) and Secure Firmware Update (SFU) solution allows the update of the STM32 microcontroller built-in
program with new firmware versions, adding new features and correcting potential issues. The update process is performed
in a secure way to prevent unauthorized updates and access to confidential on-device data such as secret code and
firmware encryption key.
In addition, Secure Boot (Root of Trust services) checks and activates the STM32 security mechanisms, and checks the
authenticity and integrity of user application code before every execution to ensure that invalid or malicious code
cannot be run. The Secure Firmware Update application receives the encrypted firmware image, decrypts it, then checks
the authenticity and integrity of the code before installing it.

The secure key management services provide cryptographic services to the user application through the pkcs11 APIs
(KEY ID based APIs) that are executed inside a protected and isolated environment. User application keys are stored in
the protected and isolated environment. They can be updated in a secure way (authenticity check, data decryption and
data integrity check).

This example supports multiple images feature configured with 2 active images for
execution from internal flash and a 1-slot configuration allowing to
maximize the user application size.
As a consequence, some features are not available:
* download a new firmware image from the application
* resume firmware update procedure in case of power off during installation

@par Hardware and Software environment

   - This example runs on STM32WL55xx devices.
   - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-WL55JC RevC board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and
     development board.
   - An up-to-date version of ST-LINK firmware is required. Upgrading ST-LINK firmware is a feature provided by
     STM32Cube programmer available on www.st.com.
   - This example is linked with SE_Core binary generated by Secure Engine Core binary generation project.
   - This example needs a terminal emulator.
   - By default, SBSFU is configured in development mode. To switch in production mode, refer to AN5056 "Integration
     guide - software expansion for STM32Cube" available from the STMicroelectronics microcontroller website
     www.st.com.
   - Microsoft Windows has a limitation whereby paths to files and directories cannot be longer than 256 characters.
     Paths to files exceeding that limits cause tools (e.g. compilers, shell scripts) to fail reading from or writing
     to such files.
     As a workaround, it is advised to use the subst.exe command from within a command prompt to set up a local drive
     out of an existing directory on the hard drive, such as:
     C:\> subst X: <PATH_TO_CUBEFW>\Firmware

@par How to use it ?

Several steps to run SBSFU application :

1. Compile projects in the following order. This is mandatory as each project requests some objects generated by the
   compilation of the previous one:
   - 2_Images_SECoreBin (see also SECoreBin/readme.txt)
   - 2_Images_SBSFU (using both CM4 and CM0+ workspaces)
   - 2_Images_UserApp_M0Plus (see also UserApp_M0Plus/readme.txt)
   - 2_Images_UserApp_M4 (see also UserApp_M4/readme.txt)

2. Before loading SBSFU image into the target, please ensure with STM32CubeProgrammer available on www.st.com that the
   following are valid for the device:
   - RDP Level 0
   - Write Protection disabled on all FLASH pages
   - Chip has been erased

3. Use a terminal emulator (Tera Term for example, open source free software terminal emulator that can be downloaded
   from https://osdn.net/projects/ttssh2/) for UART connection with the board.
   Support of YMODEM protocol is required. Serial port configuration should be :
   - Baud rate = 115200
   - Data = 8 bits
   - Parity = none
   - Stop = 1 bit
   - Flow control = none

4. Load CM4 SB image and CM0+ SBSFU image into target memory with your preferred toolchain or STM32CubeProgammer.

5. Once the SB_SFU software is downloaded, power cycle the board (unplug/plug USB cable) : the SBSFU application starts
   and configures the security mechanisms.

6. Power cycle the board a second time (unplug/plug the USB cable): the SBSFU application starts with the configured
   securities turned on and the Tera Term connection is possible.
   Caution: Make sure to use an up-to-date version of ST-LINK firmware else SBSFU may not start.

7. At startup (Power On or Reset button pushed) welcome information are displayed on terminal emulator.
   Red LED blinks every 500 ms when waiting for the CM0+ SBSFU to boot.
   Green LED blinks every 100 ms when CM0+ and/or CM4 firmware image(s) need(s) to be downloaded.
   Red LED blinks every 3 seconds when a local download is waited.
   A reboot occurs in case of error in option bytes configuration.

8. Send the first user encrypted firmware file (\1_Slot\2_Images_UserApp_M0Plus\Binary\UserApp.sfb or
   \1_Slot\2_Images_UserApp_M4\Binary\UserApp.sfb) with Tera Term by using menu
   "File > Transfer > YMODEM > Send..."

9. Send the second user encrypted firmware file (\1_Slot\2_Images_UserApp_M0Plus\Binary\UserApp.sfb or
   \1_Slot\2_Images_UserApp_M4\Binary\UserApp.sfb) with Tera Term by using menu
   "File > Transfer > YMODEM > Send..."

Note1 : Press User push-button (B1) at reset to force a local download if an application is already installed.
Note2 : As TAMPER detection can be very sensitive, the protection is disabled by default.
        Uncomment "SFU_TAMPER_PROTECT_ENABLE" in app_sfu.h to enable it.
Note3 : for Linux users Minicom can be used but to do so you need to compile the SBSFU project with the MINICOM_YMODEM
        switch enabled (app_sfu.h)
