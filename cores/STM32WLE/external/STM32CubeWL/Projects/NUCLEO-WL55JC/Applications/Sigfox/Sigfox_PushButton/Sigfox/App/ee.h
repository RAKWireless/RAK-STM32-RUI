/**
  * Description
  * -----------
  * the EE module implements an EEPROM emulator in one C file ("ee.c").
  * Its interface is defined below in this file ("ee.h").
  * Up to two independent banks can be configured.
  * Data granularity to store and read in this EEPROM emulator is a 32-bit word.
  *
  * Configuration and dependencies
  * ------------------------------
  * the EE module includes a generic header file "common.h":
  * this file has to be defined by the user and must provide the following:
  *
  * - M_BEGIN, M_END and DBG() macro definitions.
  *
  * - Hardware flash driver definitions:
  *
  *      * HW_FLASH_PAGE_SIZE (in bytes)
  *
  *      * HW_FLASH_WIDTH (in bytes)
  *
  *      * int HW_FLASH_Write( uint32_t address,
  *                            uint64_t data );
  *
  *      * int HW_FLASH_Erase( uint32_t page,
  *                            uint16_t n,
  *                            int interrupt );
  *
  * - Configuration definitions:
  *
  *     * CFG_EE_BANK0_SIZE
  *       Size of the first bank in bytes (must be greater than 0).
  *       It must be a multiple of page size.
  *
  *     * CFG_EE_BANK0_MAX_NB
  *       Maximum number of data that can be stored in the first bank.
  *
  *     * CFG_EE_BANK1_SIZE
  *       Size of the second bank in bytes (can be 0 if the bank is not used).
  *       It must be a multiple of page size.
  *
  *     * CFG_EE_BANK1_MAX_NB
  *       Maximum number of data that can be stored in the second bank.
  *
  * Notes
  * -----
  * - a corrupted word in FLASH detected by the user software shall be set to 0.
  *   The EEPROM emulation software will then handle it properly.
