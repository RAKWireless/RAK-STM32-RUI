@par Application Description

This application is used to generate Key Management Services Blob binary file to be downloaded
with KMS through the ImportBlob() API.

You can edit your own keys to generate your own Blob.

For more details, refer to UM2262 "Getting started with SBSFU - software expansion for STM32Cube"
available from the STMicroelectronics microcontroller website www.st.com.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WL55xx devices
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-WL55JC RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  - Python installation required. In addition, install the appropriate python modules as described in
    Middlewares\ST\STM32_Secure_Engine\Utilities\KeysAndImages\readme.txt


@par How to use it ?

In order to generate Secure Key Storage Blob file, you must do the following:
 - Edit the .c source file, where example of keys are provided. Update with your own keys.
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild the project
