@par Application Description

How to enter and exit low-power mode with CMSISOS2.0 RTOS API.

This application creates two threads.

   + A "RxThread" that blocks on a the "osqueue" message queue to wait for data. As soon as
     data is available in the "osqueue" the LED2 blinks.
	 
   + A "TxThread" that waits for a semaphore. Once the semaphore is released (from LPTIM ISR),
     the "TxThread" puts message in "osqueue".

Blocking for a finite period allows the kernel to stop tick interrupt
and place STM32 into stop mode - the lowest-power mode possible
that allows the CPU registers and RAM to retain their state.

In this example, non-used GPIOs are configured to analog, thus helping to reduce
the power consumption of the device.

Observed behaviour:
Each 1s, the LED2 is toggling as sign for wakeup from "Stop Mode". In fact, when the threads
are not running, i.e "Idle Mode", the FreeRTOS through the PreSleepProcessing(), that 
calls HAL_PWR_EnterSTOPMode(), makes the system enter in "STOP mode" (power consumption as low as 2mA).


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR.
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than
      the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority()
      function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.
	  
@note In "Stop Mode" the MCU isn't accessible by the debugger.
