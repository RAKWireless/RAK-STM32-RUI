@par Example Description

How to transfer data between two processors using IPCC Simplex channel mode.

This example demonstrate the usage of the simplex channel mode of IPCC as
described inside STM32WL5x reference manual (RM0453).

In Simplex channel mode, a dedicated memory location is assigned to the
communication. This buffer is used to transfer data in a single direction.
This is demonstrated using 16 char from 0x2000FFF0 to 0x2000FFFF. This
information is stored inside the __IO char *sharedBuffer. This shared
buffer must be located inside the shared memory.

Only one channel is used by both processors (channel 0 is used by default and
this setting can be adapted by changing the value of ChannelId variable. This
value must be the same on both processor).

This example must be executed on the two processors of the STM32WLxx simultaneously.
Preliminary step: Flash memory must be loaded with CPU1 and CPU2 programs.
Procedure using IDE:
  1. Compile and flash the environment IPCC_Simplex_CM4 on processor 1 side, then execute it (it will perform CPU2 boot)
  2. Compile and flash the environment IPCC_Simplex_CM0PLUS on processor 2 side
  3. Perform a system reset (or SW reset of CPU2 program only)

Inside the IPCC_Simplex_CM4 environment, processor 1:
  - Initialize the clock sources, LED1 and LED3.
  - Start the processor 2.
  - Enable the IPCC notification on remote processor sending message.
  - For 1000 transactions,
    - Send a string containing the index of the ongoing transaction to remote processor.
    - Wait for the confirmation from the remote processor.
  - Disable the IPCC notification.

Inside the Simplex_cpu2 environment, processor 2:
  - Enable the IPCC notification on remote processor sending message, initialize LED2.
  - Forever,
    - Wait for the reception of the message from the remote processor.
    - Retrieve the content of the message from remote processor.
    - Send the confirmation to remote processor.

This behavior is illustrated using LEDs.
  - LED_BLUE is associated to processor 1
  - LED_GREEN is associated to processor 2
  - LED_RED is associated to any error on both processor

  LED_BLUE and LED_GREEN must be blinking (each 100 transactions) for some seconds to illustrate the transaction between the 2 processors.
  Once 1000 transactions are done LED_BLUE and LED_GREEN are ON.

  If any error is encountered, the LED_RED is turned ON.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WL55JCxx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-WL55JC
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Load CPU1 test program, then execute it (it will perform CPU2 boot)
 - Load CPU2 test program
 - Perform a system reset (or SW reset of CPU2 program only)
 - Run the example
