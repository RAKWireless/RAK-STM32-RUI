@par Example Description 

How to use the PKA peripheral to execute modular exponentiation. This 
allows ciphering/deciphering a text in interrupt mode.

For this example, two .pem file have been created using openssl external tool. (https://www.openssl.org).
Src/rsa_pub_2048.pem and Src/rsa_priv_2048.pem, contains respectively the public and private key used in
this example.
To ease the usage of this .pem files, 2 set of files, Src/rsa_pub_2048.c and Inc/rsa_pub_2048.h and
Src/rsa_priv_2048.c and Inc/rsa_priv_2048.h are present to reflect their content. The explanation of 
how to create those file from a .pem are embedded inside both .c files.

The selected algorithm is RSA.

Based on the public key, the plain text message is ciphered using the modular exponentiation 
and stored in cipheredBuffer.

Then this ciphered buffer is deciphered using the modular exponentiation again but based on the private key and
stored in the decipheredBuffer. After this, the buffer is identical to the initial plain text.

In this example, the PKA interrupt is triggered at the end of the operation. The interrupt handler then
call the pka callback where a global variable is used to notify the main function.

In case of success, the LED2 (GREEN) is ON.
In case of any error, the LED2 (GREEN) is toggling slowly.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
