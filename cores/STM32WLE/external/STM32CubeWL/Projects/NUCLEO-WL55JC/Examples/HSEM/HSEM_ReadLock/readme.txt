@par Example Description

How to enable, take then release semaphore using 2 different Process.

First, Enable HW semaphore using __HAL_RCC_HSEM_CLK_ENABLE macro.
Secondly, Semaphore 9 with Process1(ID=12) is locked in 2-step(Write) lock procedure.
    ==> LED2 is ON when lock with Process1 is done correctly. 
Third, Lock the same semaphore 9  with Process1(ID 13) via the same semaphore 9 using 2-step(Write) lock procedure,
    ==> No lock is done, because the semaphore 9 is already locked. otherwise LED1 is ON.
Finally, semaphore 9 with Process1(ID=12) is released and take the same semaphore 9 with Process2(ID=13)
    ==> Check take status, if equal to 0, release done otherwise, LED1 is ON.
    ==> LED2 is ON, when lock with Process2 is done correctly.  
In every step, if any mismatch with right result, LED1 is ON.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WL55JCIx device.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-WL55JC RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
