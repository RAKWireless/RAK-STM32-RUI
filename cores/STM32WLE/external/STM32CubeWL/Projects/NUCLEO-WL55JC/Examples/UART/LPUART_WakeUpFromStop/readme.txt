  |_________________________|                     |_________________________|


Board 1 enters STOP mode and is awoken by Board 2 which sends
the proper data to wake up the board 1 MCU.
When the proper wake-up event is recognized, the WUF interrupt is triggered
which wakes up board 1.
To confirm its wake up, board 1 sends a confirmation message to board 2 which
checks it is the expected message.
This cycle is repeated 4 times to verify 4 different events
1°) wake-up by RXNE flag rising
2°) wake-up by Start Bit detection
3°) wake-up by 7-bit long address match
4°) wake-up by 4-bit long address match

WARNING: as both boards do not behave the same way, "BOARD_IN_STOP_MODE"
compilation switch is defined in UART/LPUART_WakeUpFromStop/Src/main.c and must
be enabled at compilation time before loading the executable in board 1 (that
which is set in STOP mode).
The stimuli-transmitting board (board 2) needs to be loaded with an executable
software obtained with BOARD_IN_STOP_MODE disabled.

At the very beginning, board 1 LED2 is ON then is turned off.
This means that board 1 has entered STOP mode.
Parallelly, board 2 LED2 is quickly blinking (100 ms period). The user has
just to wait for board 1 LED2 to be turned off then to press board 2
BUTTON_SW1 to send the first wake-up stimulus to board 1.
This starts the test sequence and no more action is required from the user
(a single BUTTON_SW1 press is needed to start the full 4 wake-up events
test sequence).

Board 1 LED2 behavior as described below allows to follow the
test progress:

Simultaneously, board 2 LED2 behavior shown below allows to follow the
test progress on the other side:

- If the test fails or if there is an initialization or transfer error, LED2
transmits a sequence of three dots, three dashes, three dots.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.

Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock
(SYSCLK) to run at the maximum frequency with HSI as source of main PLL.
Additionally the HSI is enabled to demonstrate LPUART wake-up capabilities.
Each time board 1 is awoken, the system clock (SYSCLK) is restored.


The LPUART is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud
    - Word Length = 8 bits (8 data bits, no parity bit)
    - One Stop Bit
    - Parity none
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)


@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact that the
    Cortex-M4 core is no longer clocked during low power mode and so
    debugging features are not available.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR.
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process,
      then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be
      blocked. To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use
      HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set
      to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.
