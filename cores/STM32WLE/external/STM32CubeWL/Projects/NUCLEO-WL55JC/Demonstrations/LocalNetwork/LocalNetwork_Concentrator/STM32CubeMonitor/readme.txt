The STM32WL Wireless Long Range Demo dashboard allows to monitor graphically the 
demo based on STM32WL concentrator

This directory contains the flow to be loaded in STM32CubeMonitor. (WLR_demo.json)
STM32CubeMonitor connects to the board running the Demo_Concentrator binary, configures
the geographical area and displays the list of sensors detected.


The information to install and use the dashboard are available in wiki at
