![latest tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeWL.svg?color=brightgreen)

**STM32Cube** is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease the developers life by reducing efforts, time and cost.

**STM32Cube** covers the overall STM32 products portfolio. It includes a comprehensive embedded software platform delivered for each STM32 series.
   * The CMSIS modules (core and device) corresponding to the ARM(tm) core implemented in this STM32 product.
   * The STM32 HAL-LL drivers, an abstraction layer offering a set of APIs ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio.
   * The BSP drivers of each evaluation, demonstration or nucleo board provided for this STM32 series.
   * A consistent set of middleware components such as RTOS, FatFS, LoRaWAN, Sigfox, key management services...
   * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications, and demonstrations) for each board provided for this STM32 series.

The **STM32CubeWL MCU Package** projects are directly running on the STM32WL series boards. You can find in each Projects/*Board name* directories a set of software projects (Applications/Demonstration/Examples).

In this FW Package, the modules listed below are not directly accessible as they are subject to some restrictive license terms requiring user's approval via a "click thu" procedure.
They have to be downloaded from the [www.st.com](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html) website. The respective URL to download each one of these modules are available in a readme.txt file at the root of each folder.
